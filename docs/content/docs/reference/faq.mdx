This page contains frequently asked questions about common bugs or questions around Better-Auth.

## createAuthClient not working 
When encountering `createAuthClient` related errors, make sure to have the correct import path as it varies based on enviroment.

If you're using the auth client on react front-end, you'll need to import it from `/react`:
```ts title="component.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
```

Where as if you're using the auth client in Next.js middelware, server-actions, server-components or anything server-related, you'll likely need to import it from `/client`:
```ts title="server.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
```

## getSession not working
If you're running `getSession` from the server side (such as in a React Server Component), you need to pass headers for it to work.

```ts title="server.ts"
const result = authClient.getSession({ fetchOptions: {headers: yourHeaders }});
```

If you're using Next.js, you're likely able to access `headers()` from `next/headers`: (<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers">Read more here</Link>)
```ts title="server.ts"
import { headers } from "next/headers";
//...
const result = authClient.getSession({ fetchOptions: {headers: await headers() }});
```
